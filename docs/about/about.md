WeBWorK is an Internet-based system for generating and delivering homework problems to students.
Its goal is to make homework more effective and efficient.
It increases the effectiveness of traditional homework as a learning tool.

We have been using WeBWorK at Champlain Saint-Lambert since early 2009 to deliver homework to students.
