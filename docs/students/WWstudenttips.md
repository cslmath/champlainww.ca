## Using WebWorK

### How do I log on?  

To log into WebWorK, go to
[https://www.champlainww.ca](https://www.champlainww.ca), click **Courses**, and finally
choose your course from the list.

- Your **Username** is your seven-digit student number.
- Your initial **Password** is your seven-digit student number.

As soon as you log in for the first time you should use the
**User Settings** link to:

- Change your password
- Check your email

### I changed my password and forgot it. What should I do?

Your teacher can reset your password to its initial password.

### I still can't log in.  What should I do?

See [More log in tips](WWcannotlogin.md).

## Doing WeBWorK assignments

### How do I print all the questions in my assignment?

In WeBWorK, the phrase _"Download a hardcopy"_ means print the
assignment as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. There are two
places in WeBWorK where you can print an assignment:

- From the list of Homework Sets,
    click in the box to put a check mark beside the assignment you want
    and then click on _"Download PDF or TeX Hardcopy for Selected Sets"_ (near the bottom).
- Or, from within the assignment,
    where you can see the list of problems,
    click on _"Download PDF or TeX Hardcopy for Current Set"_.

### How do I see the correct answer?

After the answer date, you may view the answer to a problem by
checking the \"Show Correct Answer\" box and then checking your
answer, or by printing your assignment (downloading a hard copy)
with answers.

3. [**I\'m sure my answer is correct, but it is scored as a wrong
answer. What can I do?**]{#d3}\
Talk to your teacher.

4. [**What happens if I answer a question right the first time, and try
it again later and get it wrong?**]{#d4}\
If you do a problem correctly once, its status will always be
Correct even if you later do the problem again incorrectly. It the
problem allows partial credit, the highest percentage correct you
receive on any attempt is recorded, regardless of which parts are
correct or not. So, to get 100% correct on a partial credit problem,
you need all parts correct on the same attempt.

### Can I get an extension on the due date?

The policy on extending due dates for homework is determined by your
teacher. WeBWorK supports individual due dates for students.

### How do I see my progress on homework for the course?

Click Grades under the Homework Sets heading in the left column.

### Can I look at closed homework sets?

Yes. You may work on the problems and have your answers checked, but
your score will not be recorded.

### In my printed assignment, I see a \"?\" (boxed) in the middle of a question. Is that a misprint?

The "?" (boxed) appears in the pdf printout whenever there is a
drop-down box menu in that question. In that case, you will need to
login to WeBWorK to view that question *online* to see the drop-down
choices available for the answer.

### I clicked on a homework set but I don\'t see any of the problems.What can I do?

You may need to scroll down the page to see the problems.

## Entering answers in WeBWorK

### How do I enter square roots or cube roots?

For square roots, you can use **sqrt()** or the exponent (1/2). For
example, the square root of two in WeBWorK is either `sqrt(2)` or
`2^(1/2)`. For cube roots, use the exponent (1/3). The cube root of 7
is then `7^(1/3)`.

### How do I enter the number $\pi$ in my answer?

Enter `pi` for the number $\pi$ in WeBWorK.

### WeBWorK says my answer is incorrect but I can\'t see what is wrong. What can I try?

- Use the Preview button to see what WeBWorK understands that you
have entered.
- See if there are any ways to simplify your answer. For example,
simplify $e^0$ to 1, simplify $1^{5/2}$  to 1, simplify $\sin\pi$ to
0, simplify $\cos(\pi)$ to -1, and so on.
- Do you expect your answer to be positive or negative? Use the
Preview button.
- Check for brackets, especially with negative numbers. For
example, `(-3)^2` is not the same as `-3^2`.
- Check how you enter exponents. For example, `e^3^x` is not the
same as `e^(3x)`.
- Check that you are using the correct brackets for intervals (see
below).
- Check that you use a dot for a decimal point and not a comma.

### How many decimal places do I need to have my answer scored correctly?

For most numerical problems, WeBWorK counts an answer within .01
percent of the right answer as correct. So, if the right answer is
12345, anything between 12343.765 and 12346.235 counts as correct.
If the correct answer is smaller, \(\pi / 2 \) for example, an answer would
need to be within about 0.0001570796 of \(\pi / 2 \) to be considered
correct.

### The answer box is too small. How do I enter my answer?

WeBWorK will accept hundreds of characters in an answer box, even if
the box size on the screen is smaller. When you enter a long answer
in a short answer box, the text scrolls to the left as you continue
to type characters.

### What do I use to enter intervals in WeBWorK?

Use a round bracket, that is, \"(\" or \")\", if the endpoint of the
interval is not included. Use a square bracket, that is, \"\[\" or
\"\]\", if the endpoint of the interval is included.
For example, enter `(-4,3)` to indicate the interval $-4<x<3$. Note:
WeBWorK will not accept \]-4,3\[ as a correct answer for that same
interval.

### Do I use a comma or a dot for the decimal point?

Use a dot for the decimal point. For example, a number such as 0.625
(that is, do not write it as 0,625).
