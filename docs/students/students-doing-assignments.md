# Doing WeBWorK assignments

## How do I print all the questions in my assignment?

In WeBWorK, the phrase _"Download a hardcopy"_ means create
Portable Document Format (PDF) file of the assignment questions.
You can download and print the PDF file.
There are two places in WeBWorK where you can create a PDF of an assignment:

- From the list of Homework Sets,
    click in the box to put a check mark beside the assignment you want
    and then click on _"Download PDF or TeX Hardcopy for Selected Sets"_ (near the bottom).
- Or, from within the assignment,
    where you can see the list of problems,
    click on _"Download PDF or TeX Hardcopy for Current Set"_.

## How do I see the correct answer?

After the answer date, you may view the answer to a problem by
checking the _"Show Correct Answer"_ box and then checking your
answer, or by printing your assignment (downloading a hard copy)
with answers.

## I'm sure my answer is correct, but it is scored as a wrong answer. What can I do?

Talk to your teacher.

## What happens if I answer a question right the first time, and try it again later and get it wrong?

If you do a problem correctly once, its status will always be
Correct even if you later do the problem again incorrectly.
If the problem allows partial credit,
the highest percentage correct you receive on any attempt is recorded,
regardless of which parts are correct or not.
So, to get 100% correct on a partial credit problem,
you need all parts correct on the same attempt.

## Can I get an extension on the due date?

The policy on extending due dates for homework is determined by your teacher.
WeBWorK supports individual due dates for students.

## How do I see my progress on homework for the course?

Click Grades under the Homework Sets heading in the left column.

## Can I look at closed homework sets?

Yes. You may work on the problems and have your answers checked,
but your score will not be recorded.

## In my printed assignment, I see a "?" (boxed) in the middle of a question. Is that a misprint?

The "?" (boxed) appears in the pdf printout whenever there is a drop-down box menu in that question.
In that case, you will need to login to WeBWorK to view that question _online_
to see the drop-down choices available for the answer.

## I clicked on a homework set but I don't see any of the problems. What can I do?

You may need to scroll down the page to see the problems.
