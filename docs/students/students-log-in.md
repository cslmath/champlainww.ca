To log into WebWorK, go to

and choose your course from the list.

- Your **Username** is your seven-digit student number.

As soon as you log in for the first time you should use the **User Settings** link to:

## I changed my password and forgot it. What should I do?

Your teacher can reset your password to its initial password.

## I still can't log in.  What should I do?
