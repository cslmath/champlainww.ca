# I Still Cannot Log In

## If you cannot log in to WeBWorK

- Are you accessing the **correct course**?
    + Check the **course name**. For example, Calculus 1 Science courses
        begin with 201-NYA, whereas Calculus 1 Social Science (Commerce)
        courses begin with 201-103. Linear Algebra Science courses begin
        with 201-NYC, while Linear Algebra Social Science courses
        begin with 201-105.
    + Check **your teacher's name**. All courses have the teacher's name at
        the end.
    + Your teacher might have more than one course, or more than one
        section of the same course.
        Make sure that you are choosing the correct course and section.
- Are you using the **correct password**?
    + Your WeBWorK password is different from the password given to
        you by the College.
    + Your initial WeBWorK password is the same as your student ID.
    + Even if you used WeBWorK in the past, your WeBWorK password gets
        reset at the beginning of every semester and for every course.

## Your teacher can reset your password

If you still cannot log in, talk to your teacher. If needed, your
teacher can reset your password for you.
