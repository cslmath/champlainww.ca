# I Still Cannot Log In

## If you cannot log in to WeBWorK

- Are you accessing the **correct course**?
    + Check the **course name**.
      For example, _Calculus 1 Science_ courses begin with 201-SN2,
      whereas _Calculus 1 Social Science_ courses begin with 201-SC1.
      _Linear Algebra Science_ courses begin with 201-SN4,
      while _Linear Algebra Social Science_ courses begin with 201-SLA.
    + Check **your teacher's name**.
        All courses have the teacher's name at the end.
    + Your teacher might have more than one course,
        or more than one section of the same course.
        Make sure that you are choosing the correct course and section.
- Are you using the **correct password**?
    + Your WeBWorK password is different from the password given to
        you by the College.
    + Your initial WeBWorK password is the same as your student ID.
    + Even if you used WeBWorK in the past, your WeBWorK password gets
        reset in every new course.

## Your teacher can reset your password

If you still cannot log in, talk to your teacher.
If needed, your teacher can reset your password for you.
