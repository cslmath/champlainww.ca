It had its seeds in the CAPA system for Physics homework. As of June 2020, there are more than 1300 institutions using WeBWorK world-wide From the WeBWorK Wiki WeBWorK is a well-tested homework system for delivering individualized problems over the web. By providing students with immediate feedback as to the correctness of their answers, students can be encouraged to make multiple attempts until they succeed. With individualized problem sets, students can work together but will have to enter their own work to receive credit. The instructors are provided with real-time statistics, resulting in lesson plans that can be customized to better serve students. As of June 2020 there were more than 1300 institutions using WeBWorK and the Open Problem library now has over 35,000 curated and indexed exercises. The majority of the institutions using this homework system are located in the USA, but many are located in Canada and Mexico, as well as in Europe, Asia, and Africa.","title":"WeBWorK"},{"location":"about/about.html","text":"WeBWorK is an Internet-based system for generating and delivering homework problems to students.

The Basic Method Pick a random integer between 2 and 5 (inclusive), and put it in the variable $a1 : An integer between 2 and 5 $a1 = random ( 2 , 5 ); Pick a random number between 2 and 5 using steps of 0.1, and put it in the variable $a2 : A number between 2 and 5, step size of 0.1 $a2 = random ( 2 , 5 , 0.1 ); Pick a random integer between -2 and 5, but exclude zero (which might cause errors in the problem): A non-zero integer between -2 and 5 $a3 = non_zero_random ( - 2 , 5 ); Fancier Randomization Suppose we have already picked one number, $a , and now we want to pick $b so that it is between 1 to 10 but not equal to $a . The basic form is: do { $b = random ( 1 , 10 ); } until ( $b != $a ); This will keep picking random numbers until we have one we like. The condition in the until clause can contain more than one comparison. Pick $c different from both $a and $b do { $b = random ( 1 , 10 ); } until (( $c != $a ) and ( $c != $b )); Picking from a list Sometimes, you might want to pick from a list of numbers. $a = list_random ( 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 15 , 18 ); Connected variables It may happen that, in a problem, several variables are connected. Using a single random parameter, the values of several variables can be selected. Here is an example where three variables, element , atomic weight - mantissa , and atomic weight - exponent are linked.

Some teachers like to prefix with set name with a sequence number, or some other identifier: ASN or Review etc. Leave the default as a new empty set selected and press the Take Action! button. WeBWorK reports the success (or failure) of the action at the top of the page (just under the header Hmwk Sets Editor).

Add problems to your set Select Library Browser (from the Main Menu on the left). In the Library Browser choose your set from the drop down box Add problems to Target Set: Under the section of the screen where you just selected your set is the section where you choose which library to work in. You have various options - the default option, the National Problem Library, is the question library we will use today. Choose a Subject, Chapter, and Section of the National Problem Library to search for questions. Choose your preferred display mode. Any one should work for today. jsMath and LaTeXMathML are preferred, but both can have problems on slow computers or older browsers. Now press the View Problems button. You should see a list of problems, each in a box. Generally you will proceed by marking problems to add to the set then updating the set to add the problems that you have marked to the set. Above the list of problems are a number of buttons: Mark All For Adding, Clear All Marks, and Update Set do what they say they do. Re-randomize will show you the same problems with a different random seed. Clear Problem Display will not undo any changes that you have made to the set with Update Set, but otherwise will reset the display back to before you pressed View Problems. At the top of each problem box is the file name of the problem. This is followed by two check boxes. The first, Don\u2019t show this problem on the next update, you can select if you have definitely decided that you won\u2019t use this problem in this homework set. Select the second box, Add this problem to the target set on the next update, to add the problem to your set. Neither box has any effect until you press the Update Set button. At the right of each problem box are two links Edit it and Try it. Edit it allows you to edit a local copy of the source code for the problem. Editing the source code is not a topic for today\u2019s seminar (it can be complicated to randomize the problems properly), but you may want to take a peek at one to see what the source code looks like. The Try it link allows you try the problem from a student\u2019s point of view. Select problems with the Add this problem to the target set on the next update box and add them to your set by pressing the Update Set button. Homework set detail Once you are satisfied with the problems in the set go back to the Hmwk Sets Editor. You should see your set listed at the bottom of the page. From here you can Edit Set Data (by clicking the pencil), you can edit the set detail (by clicking the number of problems under Edit Problems), or assign the set to students (by clicking the 0/15 under Edit Assigned Users). Click the number under Edit Problems to go to the Set Detail page for your homework set. Under General Information set an opening date, due date, and answer display date for your assignment. The date format is MM/DD/YYYY. We don\u2019t know (yet) how to change this. The defaults Visible to Students: Yes and Assignment type - homework are fine for us. Each homework set has two headers associated with it. One is displayed as part of the web page when the student views at the homework set on our WeBWorK site. The second is displayed at the top of the pdf page when the student prepares to print a hardcopy of the assignment. For now use the default headers. The rest of the page allows you to fine tune the assignment by reordering problems or changing their weighting. You can also restrict the number of attempts allowed for a problem. Unlimited attempts is the default and this is what we recommend. Choose Save Changes before you leave this page, else all your work here will be lost. Your set is ready to go. It only remains to assign the set to some students. Assign homework set to users Go back to the Hmwk Sets Editor. For your set, under Edit Assigned Users you should see 0/15 indicating that your set is assigned to none of the 15 students and professors in this course. Click on 0/15 to remedy this. On the Users Assigned to Set \u2026 screen you can either: Click the button Assign to All Current Users, assigning the set to all users in the course or, Assign the set to a subset of course users by checking the relevant boxes and pressing the Save button. Proofread the homework set Before quitting, proofread your assignment. Once you have assigned your set to yourself, you should see it listed in the Main Menu under Homework Sets. Clicking this link will take you to a display similar to what the students see. Read the contents of the Set Info box on the right of the page ensuring that it says what you want to say. Step through the problems as another check. You will see the problem source file name listed for your benefit. The students do not see this. Go back up to the problem list and click Download a hardcopy of this homework set.

Each question is one of three types: (1) Multiple Choice, (2) Multiple Select, or (3) True or False. Examples of the three types of questions Multiple Choice Exactly one answer is correct. The choice order changes, but \u201cNone of the above\u201d is always last. Multiple Select At least one answer is correct. The choice order changes, but \u201cNone of the above\u201d is always last. True or False Use Diagnostic Quizzes out of the box Each Quiz contains five questions that are drawn randomly from a larger grouping set of ten or more questions. Refer to the Tables below on Quiz grouping sets . Each Quiz is a timed quiz to be completed in 15 minutes. Note There are many ways randomization occurs in these quizzes, such as: random choice of five questions, random order in which choices appear in the Multiple choice or select types, as well as random changes in numbers, variables, words and phrases, and functions. Example To use Quiz 16 Chain Rule with Trig (Note: the grouping set is topic-diffrules-chain-withtrig ) Info Unlike a regular WeBWorK homework assignment whose definition depends on two types of files, problem ( .pg ) files and set definition ( .def ) files, these quizzes depend on three types of files.

To avoid, as much as possible, the classification of WeBWorK server emails as spam by the Office 365 email system at the college, I suggest three things: Whitelist our email server in Office 365. Check your Junk email folder regularly for false positives. Train Office 365 that any false positives are not spam. Whitelist the WeBWorK email server Follow the following steps to add mg.champlainww.ca as a safe domain in your Office 365 Junk email settings.

(Optional) Add a second new entry with the contents champlainww.ca . Scroll down to Save your changes. Check your junk email directory regularly I suggest that you check your Office 365 Junk email folder at least once a week (more often is better). Even if you use another email client, if the problem is that Office 365 is labelling WeBWorK email as spam, then we have to train Office 365 that WeBWorK email is not spam.

In a nutshell, students can earn achievements by meeting preset goals. For example, they might earn an achievement for solving 3 homework problems in a row without any incorrect submissions, or for solving a problem after taking an 8 hour break. Earning achievements and solving problems earns students points and after a student gets enough points they will be given a new Level. Depending on settings the math level may come with an Achievement Items. Students can view their current level and their progress towards various achievements by visiting the Achievements page. Instructors can modify and administer achievements by using the Achievement Editor page. - Achievements - WeBWorK Wiki This page is an introduction to writing custom Math Achievements.

Or, from within the assignment, where you can see the list of problems, click on \u201cDownload PDF or TeX Hardcopy for Current Set\u201d . How do I see the correct answer? After the answer date, you may view the answer to a problem by checking the \u201cShow Correct Answer\u201d box and then checking your answer, or by printing your assignment (downloading a hard copy) with answers. I\u2019m sure my answer is correct, but it is scored as a wrong answer. What can I do? It is possible that your answer is correct, but that the WeBWorK question expects more numerical accuracy. Try including more decimal places in your answer. If that doesn\u2019t work, talk to your teacher. What happens if I answer a question right the first time, and try it again later and get it wrong? If you do a problem correctly once, its status will always be Correct even if you later do the problem again incorrectly. If the problem allows partial credit, the highest percentage correct you receive on any attempt is recorded, regardless of which parts are correct or not. So, to get 100% correct on a partial credit problem, you need all parts correct on the same attempt. Can I get an extension on the due date? The policy on extending due dates for homework is determined by your teacher. WeBWorK supports individual due dates for students. How do I see my progress on homework for the course? Click Grades under the Homework Sets heading in the left column. Can I look at closed homework sets? Yes. You may work on the problems and have your answers checked, but your score will not be recorded. In my printed assignment, I see a \u201c?\u201d (boxed) in the middle of a question. Is that a misprint? The \u201c?\u201d (boxed) appears in the pdf printout whenever there is a drop-down box menu in that question. In that case, you will need to login to WeBWorK to view that question online to see the drop-down choices available for the answer. I clicked on a homework set but I don\u2019t see any of the problems. What can I do? You may need to scroll down the page to see the problems.","title":"Doing assignments"},{"location":"students/students-doing-assignments.html#how-do-i-print-all-the-questions-in-my-assignment","text":"In WeBWorK, the phrase \u201cDownload a hardcopy\u201d means create Portable Document Format (PDF) file of the assignment questions.

What can I do?"},{"location":"students/students-entering-answers.html","text":"Entering Answers into WeBWorK How do I enter square roots or cube roots? For square roots, you can use sqrt() or the exponent 1/2 . For example, the square root of two in WeBWorK is either sqrt(2) or 2^(1/2) . For cube roots, use the exponent 1/3 . The cube root of 7 is then 7^(1/3) . Remember to put parentheses around fractional exponents: 7^(1/3) is not the same as 7^1/3 . How do I enter the number \\(\\pi\\) in my answer? Enter pi for the number \\(\\pi\\) in WeBWorK. WeBWorK says my answer is incorrect but I can\u2019t see what is wrong. What can I try? Use the Preview button to see that WeBWorK understands what you have entered. See if there are any ways to simplify your answer. For example, simplify \\(e^0\\) to 1, simplify \\(1^{5/2}\\) to 1, simplify \\(\\sin\\pi\\) to 0, simplify \\(\\cos(\\pi)\\) to -1, and so on. Do you expect your answer to be positive or negative? Check for bracket errors, especially with negative numbers. For example, (-3)^2 is not the same as -3^2 . Check how you are entering exponents. For example, e^3^x is not the same as e^(3x) . Check that you are using the correct brackets for intervals (see below ). Check that you are using a dot for a decimal point and not a comma. How many decimal places do I need to have my answer scored correctly? For most numerical problems, WeBWorK counts an answer within .01 percent of the right answer as correct. So, if the right answer is 12345, anything between 12343.765 and 12346.235 counts as correct. If the correct answer is smaller, \\(\\pi / 2 \\) for example, an answer would need to be within about 0.0001570796 of \\(\\pi / 2 \\) to be considered correct. The answer box is too small. How do I enter my answer? WeBWorK will accept hundreds of characters in an answer box, even if the box size on the screen is smaller. When you enter a long answer in a short answer box, the text scrolls to the left as you continue to type characters. How do I enter intervals in WeBWorK? Use a round bracket, that is, \u201c ( \u201d or \u201c ) \u201d, if the endpoint of the interval is not included. Use a square bracket, that is, \u201c [ \u201d or \u201c ] \u201d, if the endpoint of the interval is included. For example, enter (-4,3) to indicate the interval \\(-4<x<3\\) . WeBWorK will not accept ]-4,3[ as a correct answer for that interval. Do I use a comma or a dot for the decimal point? Use a dot for the decimal point. For example, enter 0.625 not 0,625.","title":"Entering answers"},{"location":"students/students-entering-answers.html#how-do-i-enter-square-roots-or-cube-roots","text":"For square roots, you can use sqrt() or the exponent 1/2 .
