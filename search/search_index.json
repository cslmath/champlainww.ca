It\u2019s encouraging. Quote Its different from doing problems on paper, its really fast and it is really my generation. Quote I liked the way it is online and you can do it at home and know whether it is immediately correct or wrong. Quote I can fix my mistakes while the problem is fresh in my mind.

It had its seeds in the CAPA system for Physics homework. As of June 2020, there are more than 1300 institutions using WeBWorK world-wide From the WeBWorK Wiki WeBWorK is a well-tested homework system for delivering individualized problems over the web. By providing students with immediate feedback as to the correctness of their answers, students can be encouraged to make multiple attempts until they succeed. With individualized problem sets, students can work together but will have to enter their own work to receive credit. The instructors are provided with real-time statistics, resulting in lesson plans that can be customized to better serve students. As of June 2020 there were more than 1300 institutions using WeBWorK and the Open Problem library now has over 35,000 curated and indexed exercises. The majority of the institutions using this homework system are located in the USA, but many are located in Canada and Mexico, as well as in Europe, Asia, and Africa.","title":"WeBWorK"},{"location":"about/about.html","text":"WeBWorK is an Internet-based system for generating and delivering homework problems to students.

Choose a Subject, Chapter, and Section of the National Problem Library to search for questions. Choose your preferred display mode.

Above the list of problems are a number of buttons: Mark All For Adding, Clear All Marks, and Update Set do what they say they do. Re-randomize will show you the same problems with a different random seed.

What can I do?"},{"location":"students/students-entering-answers.html","text":"Entering Answers into WeBWorK How do I enter square roots or cube roots? For square roots, you can use sqrt() or the exponent 1/2 . For example, the square root of two in WeBWorK is either sqrt(2) or 2^(1/2) . For cube roots, use the exponent 1/3 . The cube root of 7 is then 7^(1/3) . How do I enter the number \\(\\pi\\) in my answer? Enter pi for the number \\(\\pi\\) in WeBWorK. WeBWorK says my answer is incorrect but I can\u2019t see what is wrong. What can I try? Use the Preview button to see that WeBWorK understands what you have entered. See if there are any ways to simplify your answer. For example, simplify \\(e^0\\) to 1, simplify \\(1^{5/2}\\) to 1, simplify \\(\\sin\\pi\\) to 0, simplify \\(\\cos(\\pi)\\) to -1, and so on. Do you expect your answer to be positive or negative? Check for bracket errors, especially with negative numbers. For example, (-3)^2 is not the same as -3^2 . Check how you are entering exponents. For example, e^3^x is not the same as e^(3x) . Check that you are using the correct brackets for intervals (see below ). Check that you are using a dot for a decimal point and not a comma. How many decimal places do I need to have my answer scored correctly? For most numerical problems, WeBWorK counts an answer within .01 percent of the right answer as correct. So, if the right answer is 12345, anything between 12343.765 and 12346.235 counts as correct. If the correct answer is smaller, \\(\\pi / 2 \\) for example, an answer would need to be within about 0.0001570796 of \\(\\pi / 2 \\) to be considered correct. The answer box is too small. How do I enter my answer? WeBWorK will accept hundreds of characters in an answer box, even if the box size on the screen is smaller. When you enter a long answer in a short answer box, the text scrolls to the left as you continue to type characters. How do I enter intervals in WeBWorK? Use a round bracket, that is, \u201c ( \u201d or \u201c ) \u201d, if the endpoint of the interval is not included. Use a square bracket, that is, \u201c [ \u201d or \u201c ] \u201d, if the endpoint of the interval is included. For example, enter (-4,3) to indicate the interval \\(-4<x<3\\) . WeBWorK will not accept ]-4,3[ as a correct answer for that interval. Do I use a comma or a dot for the decimal point? Use a dot for the decimal point. For example, enter 0.625 not 0,625.","title":"Entering answers"},{"location":"students/students-entering-answers.html#how-do-i-enter-square-roots-or-cube-roots","text":"For square roots, you can use sqrt() or the exponent 1/2 .
